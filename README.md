Syber Tickets is a web 3.0 ticketing application that is reshaping the very essence of event ticketing. Powered by smart contracts on the Polygon Network, Syber Tickets uses the concept of soulbound NFTs to issue non-transferable event tickets. (Deployed to the Polygon Matic test network).

The project is Deployed Live to the Polygon Matic test network and can also be deployed locally if cloned to your machine.
